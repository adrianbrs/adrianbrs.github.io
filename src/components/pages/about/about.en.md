I am a **Software Engineer** passionate about computing, physics, astronomy and science in general.

I started programming in Java at the age of 14, having fun creating Minecraft plugins and servers.

I started studying **Computer Science** at the age of 18, where I had the opportunity to teach some <a href="https://www.upf.br/Ingresso/Noticias/projeto-de-extensao-da-upf-busca-capacitar-jovens-em-pensamento-computacional" target="_blank" title="UPF extension project seeks to train young people in computational thinking">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.upf.br/Ingresso/Noticias/projeto-go-code-blocks-promove-a-interacao-com-a-comunidade" target="_blank" title="Project Go Code [Blocks] promotes interaction with the community">Thunkable X</a> courses to high school students and participate on the <a href="https://maratona.sbc.org.br/hist/2019/index.html" target="_blank" title="ACM ICPC Brazilian Finals 2019">ACM ICPC South America/Brazil Finals</a> in Campina Grande, PB.

Currently I work as a full-stack developer, using technologies such as:

- Front-End: Vue, Angular e React;
- Back-End: NodeJS, Java, PHP e Python;
- Databases: relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB, Redis);

I have experience with DevOps, using Google Cloud Platform, GitHub Actions and Docker, and experience in creating themes and apps for the Shopify platform, using Liquid and GraphQL.

I am always looking to evolve as a person and as a professional, learning new things and facing new challenges.

In my free time, I like to work with vintage cars, visit new places and study other subjects outside my area of expertise.
